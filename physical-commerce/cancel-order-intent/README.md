# Cancel Order Intent
Although retailers do everything they can to ensure customers are satisfied, there come times when a customer asks to cancel their order. This intent provides a baseline set of utterances which can be used in your interaction model for that purpose.

## List of Utterances
Use these values if your tool uses a simple list as the input mechanism (e.g. developer consoleâ€™s [Bulk Edit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html#edit-or-upload-sample-utterances-in-bulk)).
