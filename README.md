# Resources: Intents and Slots
In this folder you will find intents you can use as a starting point for your skill.  They are grouped by general use case, and if there is an intent that is designed to work with a slot of a specific type, that slot type will be included as part of the resource. In some cases, the resource is just a slot type, which you can add to your interaction model.

> You will get the best recognition results when using [built-in intents](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/built-in-intent-library.html) and [built-in slots](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html). Before using a custom intent or slot, check the list of available built-in intents and slots for one suitable to your use case.

## Using Intents
For each intent, there are two formats supplied.  The content is identical, so choose the format that works best for you.  The first is a simple list of utterances.  This is useful when you want to copy/paste the utterances into the [Bulk Edit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html#edit-or-upload-sample-utterances-in-bulk) option when creating an intent.  The second is when you want to integrate the intent into a JSON-based interaction model (either through the [developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html#json-for-intents-and-utterances-interaction-model-schema) or through another tool).

## Using the Slots
For each slot type, there are two formats supplied.  The content is identical, so choose the format that works best for you.  The first is a comma-separated list of values.  This is useful when you want to copy/paste the utterances into the Bulk Edit option when creating a slot type.  The second is when you want to integrate the intent into a JSON-based interaction model (either through the developer console or through another tool).
